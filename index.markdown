## TRAVELLING TO MAURITIUS
Here is some indications on what may be necessary if you are traveling to Mauritius

### VISA 
Make sure that you have the required official documents according to your country.You can check the official site of the government of Mauritius [here](https://passport.govmu.org/passport/?page_id=605) and with the Mauritian Embassy in your country. 

### MAURITIUS ALL-IN-ONE TRAVEL DIGITAL [FORM](https://safemauritius.govmu.org/) - COMPULSORY
ALL travellers are encouraged to fill-in the Mauritius All-in-One Digital Travel Form electronically prior to arrival in order to avoid any substantial delay at the airport counters. Data collected for the purpose of immigration and health surveillance complies with our Data Protection Act.

ALL passengers be it resident or international visitors, need to fill in the following form prior to arrival: Mauritius All-in-One Travel Digital [Form](https://safemauritius.govmu.org/)

This has been an effective method to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in our small island. Thank you for your understanding.

### TRAVEL INSURANCE
Make sure you have all required documents.

### What to bring
The temperature will be about 15 to 25 degrees celsius in the coastal region. The humidity level and sea breeze may create a sensation of cold after sunset. A light jacket, leggings and socks would be useful for that purpose so as to sleep warm and comfortable. Otherwise, the normal yoga wear such as leggings, jogging, yoga pants, T-shirts, tops, or any comfortable garments would do for the scheduled activities.  A pair of flip-flops, sunscreen, mosquito repellent, hat and sunglasses are the usual items among others not to forget at any cost.
