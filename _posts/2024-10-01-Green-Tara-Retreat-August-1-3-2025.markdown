## SUMMARY
This 3-day immersion with the Divine Mother in the form of Green Tara will definitely bring a more profound connection with Mother Earth and your feminine part of compassion, peace, fluidity, love, generosity. We will practise a very simple yet powerful sadhana. Green Tara practice is open to all and not confined to a certain lineage. The group consciousness acts as a catalyst in our spiritual journey. 

We will have an introduction to Buddhist philosophy, learn a simple Green Tara practice, enjoy creative activities, connect with the 5 elements of Nature and Existence.

At the third roundabout, there is only one exit after completing three quarters of the circle, towards Port-Louis. At the fourth roundabout, join the M2 and follow the way in the direction of Port-Louis until Highlands roundabout. Just after that, you will see Le Valentine Shopping Mall on the left. Leave the first 2 exits, then take the third one towards Phoenix commercial centre and take the Phoenix-Beaux Songes Link Rd till Beaux Songes then A3 until Cascavelle which will lead you to the coastal road. Continue to Flic en Flac Police station. Stay on the coastal road till Manisa hotel after which you can turn left. Take the first left then first right. The road will turn to the left. We are the third property on the left.
