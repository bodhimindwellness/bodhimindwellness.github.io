## SUMMARY
This 3-day immersion with the Divine Mother in the form of Green Tara will definitely bring a more profound connection with Mother Earth and your feminine part of compassion, peace, fluidity, love, generosity. We will practise a very simple yet powerful sadhana. Green Tara practice is open to all and not confined to a certain lineage. The group consciousness acts as a catalyst in our spiritual journey. 

We will have an introduction to Buddhist philosophy, learn a simple Green Tara practice, enjoy creative activities, connect with the 5 elements of Nature and Existence.
