## SUMMARY
Maybe you are checking this retreat out of curiosity not knowing how it may change your outlook on life or mindset. 

Sometimes we are in search of a small pause with like-minded people, sharing time in a playful mode with laughter without the usual seriousness of a life controlled by the clock. Life suddenly becomes light and full of happiness. Having spiritual support like the Green Tara helps us bring this lightness.

This 3-day immersion with the Divine Mother in the form of Green Tara will definitely bring a more profound connection with Mother Earth and your feminine part of compassion, peace, fluidity, love, generosity. We will practise a very simple yet powerful sadhana. Green Tara practice is open to all and not confined to a certain lineage. The group consciousness is essential, it acts as a catalyst for our vibrations to resonate in union as the plucking of different strings of a guitar makes a complex ensemble - music .

We will have an introduction to Buddhist philosophy, learn a simple Green Tara practice, enjoy creative activities, connect with the 5 elements of Nature and Existence.

Join our Dharani Wellness Retreat (yoga, meditation, life coaching) happening prior to this one at the same location. [See other retreats](https://bodhimindwellness.com/)
