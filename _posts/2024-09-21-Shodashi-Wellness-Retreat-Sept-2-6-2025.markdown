## SUMMARY
<i>''Mauritius was made first, and then heaven; and heaven was copied after Mauritius.” - Mark Twain </i>

Yoga. Meditation. Coaching.

Relax on the sunny beach and turquoise lagoon in the Indian Ocean.

An opportunity to bring and consolidate harmony, stability and peace within. A learning process with the application of hatha yoga, meditation and life coaching to understand and explore the ‘self’ according to the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions, with a view of rendering a permanent transformation within and opening the doors to serenity durably. Experience a restoring pause and go back to normal life with the peace of the tropical sky in your mind, glitter of the island sunshine in your eyes and mostly the warmth of the Mauritian hospitality in your hearts.

Individual life coaching will ensure that each finds their way and unfolds the journey towards their chosen aspirations and purpose. As a group, we will grow together through the community space of sharing and expanding our understanding. 

We have tried to bring the most out of the retreat in a jist for 5 days where you can unwind, absorb the new and leave re(un)structured for a better life, made possible with the help of Eastern philosophy, mysticism and spirituality. 

Take a look at our Dharani (July 27-31) and Green Tara retreats (August 1-3, 2025) at Flic en Flac.

## DESCRIPTION
Join us for this awesome luxury retreat on the south coast of Mauritius island with all that is necessary to make your stay unforgettable. Take a [virtual tour](https://my.threesixty.tours/app/v/308jvj/0y6a4i) to get an idea of the fantastic location that awaits you. 

Yoga has a lot to offer towards opening the gates to consciousness. It clears and nourishes the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions which are the pillars for a wholesome human being. 


In this retreat, you will enjoy DAILY outdoor classes of:

+ 2 hours of hatha yoga. Yoga postures help to detoxify the physical body, bring strength, flexibility and stability.
+ Alignment and adjustment of postures so as to become more aware of wrongly-performed yoga postures to avoid harming the body through microtrauma and bring confidence and stability in self-practice.
+ Yoga nidra for a deep restorative whole body relaxation comparable to the dreamless state during sleep, though here consciousness will be maintained and 
+ Pranayama or breathing techniques to bring balance in our subtle energy channels or nadis to clear and bring balance to the flow of bioelectric energy responsible for maintaining good health.
+ Meditation where we deepen our presence in silence using different active techniques such as visualisation or chanting as well as passive ones such as being the witness and getting grounded in observation and contemplation or mindfulness. Meditation becomes easier and glimpses of silence happen more often when practised in a group.
+ Classes on yoga philosophy to better understand and consolidate all the learning process in the right direction that is towards the centre of our being through integration.
+ Group gathering and sharing or me-times - whatever suits you 
+ 3 individual life coaching sessions for personal assimilation: one before the reteat, one during and one after.

Living these 5 days to the fullest will surely bring the desired change in the dimension of your life you choose.

## FOOD
The price of the retreat includes the cost of staying full board. Meals provided: breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Free choice a la carte breakfast, lunch and diner. 
In ayurveda, one of the common ways of toxin production in the body is through bad digestion. Digestion depends not only on the type of food but predominantly, on our emotional-mental state. If we are happy and like what we eat, digestion happens efficiently and health is maintained. 
The location is exceptionally beautiful and many participants like to celebrate their trip. We do not have any intention of dousing your happiness. It will be the fuel for your enthusiastic effort in the retreat. No restrictions will be applied on the type of food allowed during the retreat. Instead, we will practise mindful eating where you will become more conscious of the effects of the food on your being. Consciousness will be our leitmotif all throughout so that it intensifies during your stay and remains thereafter.
