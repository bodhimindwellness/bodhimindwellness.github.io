### What to bring
The temperature will be about 15 to 25 degrees celsius in the coastal region. The humidity level and sea breeze may create a sensation of cold after sunset. A light jacket, leggings and socks would be useful for that purpose so as to sleep warm and comfortable. Otherwise, the normal yoga wear such as leggings, jogging, yoga pants, T-shirts, tops, or any comfortable garments would do for the scheduled activities.  A pair of flip-flops, sunscreen, mosquito repellent, hat and sunglasses are the usual items among others not to forget at any cost.
