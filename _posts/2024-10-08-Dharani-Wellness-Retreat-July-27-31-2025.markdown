## SUMMARY
Easy yoga practice. Nature immersion. Cultural tour. All optional. Participate at your own pace, alone, with a buddy or your sweetheart for great intimate moments shared in wellness or why not as a group of friends or family for a healthy stay on a tropical paradise island.

Enjoy a full-on ecotourist retreat where your day starts with a comfortable yoga practice (or time alone) followed by long walks in awesome nature spots in our endemic tropical forest on Mauritius island. Come back to relax on the white sandy beach and have a dip in the safe turquoise lagoon protected by coral reefs and nurtured by the Indian Ocean, finishing the day with a breathtaking sunset. On the third day, we’ll dab in the Mauritian cultural roots with a visit to our capital city of Port Louis, led by our facilitators.

We have tried to bring the most out of the retreat in a gist of 5 days where you can take care of yourself, enjoy the sea, forest, rivers and waterfalls as well as have a tour in the capital city of Mauritius to get a short but sweet experience of the Mauritian culture. It is a good start for your stay in Mauritius where you can experience much more.
