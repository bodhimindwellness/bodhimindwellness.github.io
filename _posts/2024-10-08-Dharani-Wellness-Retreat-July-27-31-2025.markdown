## SUMMARY
Easy yoga practice. Nature immersion. Cultural tour. 

Enjoy a full-on ecotourist retreat where your day starts with a comfortable yoga practice (or time alone) followed by long walks in awesome nature spots in our endemic tropical forest on Mauritius island. Come back to relax on the white sandy beach and have a dip in the safe turquoise lagoon protected by coral reefs and nurtured by the Indian Ocean, finishing the day with a breathtaking sunset. On the third day, we’ll dab in the Mauritian cultural roots with a visit to our capital city of Port Louis, led by our facilitators.
