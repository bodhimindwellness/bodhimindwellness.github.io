Danitza, a personal development coach, is passionate about personal development and marvels at the  fact that the brain and mind are such powerful tools that they can help transform your life. Fascinated by the hundreds of biographies that tell of ordinary people creating extraordinary lives,  Danitza wanted to understand how these people managed to do it, while others did not. Her passion led  her to want to know more about human psychology, so she trained in Counselling (Master of Arts in  Counselling-Mauritius).  
Danitza's helps young girls and women discover or rediscover their 'Inner Power', because  she is convinced that within each of them lies a well of infinite potential. She aims to help women go  deep inside themselves to find the key or the little flame that will make them gain or regain their self confidence.  
Her years of learning now help her to develop tools to better help each person and each personality. Do you want to discover your 'inner power', change your life, change course, achieve a goal, live your  dreams, let go of fear, or reconnect with your "Self"? 
If this resonates with you, contact Danitza for a first online session.
