## Counseling 
 Our wellness coaches will guide you through your current needs. Acting as an initiator to your journey towards self-discovery, each team member will endeavour to show you how to go about unraveling your own labyrinth. You will learn how to analyse yourself so that you will understand how to satisfy your needs and how to avoid getting into a state which will require external help. You can become your own best friend, coach, adviser so as to support yourself optimally.
  + Online
  + Face to face at Bras Panon, Ile de la RÃ©union
